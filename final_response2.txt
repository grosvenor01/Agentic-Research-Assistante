The research on Gemini, GPT-4, and Mixtral-style Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models reveals distinct architectural features, design choices, and capabilities. Scholarly sources indicate that Gemini is a recent AI model with a focus on advanced multimodal processing and large-scale training, emphasizing reasoning ability and inference efficiency. GPT-4, developed by OpenAI, is characterized by its transformer-based architecture with extensive parameterization, optimized for both reasoning and scalability, and incorporates innovations like few-shot learning and multimodal capabilities. Mixtral-style MoE models utilize a mixture-of-experts approach, deploying multiple specialized subnetworks to improve scalability and inference cost management, often used in large language models to enhance performance while maintaining efficiency. These models differ in their core design principles: Gemini emphasizes multimodal integration and reasoning, GPT-4 balances scale and versatility with advanced training techniques, and Mixtral MoE models focus on modular, scalable architectures that optimize inference costs. The architectural innovations underpin their respective strengths in reasoning, inference efficiency, and scalability, with each model tailored to specific application domains and computational constraints.
