Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was ... benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine-tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B - Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B - chat model on human benchmarks.

The models come in various sizes such as Ultra, Pro, and Nano, optimized for different applications ranging from complex reasoning to device-constrained environments. Gemini models are trained jointly across multiple data types, enabling advanced multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities. They outperform many existing models in multimodal tasks and are designed with responsible deployment practices.\\n\\n**GPT-4:** Developed by OpenAI, GPT-4 is a large-scale multimodal Transformer-based model capable of processing both image and text inputs to generate text outputs. It exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing the bar exam. GPT-4 is trained to predict the next token in a sequence and is fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). It is known for its versatility in NLP tasks, with high performance on benchmarks like MMLU.\\n\\n**Mixtral-style Mixture-of-Experts (MoE):** Mixtral is a sparse MoE language model with a large number of parameters (up to 47B active during inference). It features multiple experts per layer, with a router network selecting a subset of experts for each token, enabling efficient scaling and specialization. Variants like Mixtral 8x7B and 8x22B outperform models like Llama 2 70B on various benchmarks, including mathematics, code generation, and multilingual tasks. The MoE architecture allows for high scalability and efficiency during inference.\\n\\n### Key Features and Design Principles\\n\\n- **Gemini:** Multimodal joint training, multiple sizes, advanced multimodal understanding, responsible deployment.\\n- **GPT-4:** Transformer architecture, multimodal inputs, high benchmark performance, fine-tuning with RLHF.\\n- **Mixtral MoE:** Sparse routing, expert specialization, large parameter count with active parameters during inference, high scalability.\\n\\n### Impact on Reasoning, Costs, and Scalability\\n\\n- **Reasoning Capabilities:** Gemini and GPT-4 demonstrate advanced reasoning across multiple modalities, with Gemini showing remarkable multimodal reasoning and GPT-4 excelling in professional and academic benchmarks. Mixtral's expert routing enables complex reasoning by leveraging specialized experts.\\n- **Inference Costs:** Mixtral's sparse MoE architecture reduces inference costs by activating only a subset of parameters. GPT-4 and Gemini, with their large sizes, have higher inference costs but are optimized for efficiency through model design and training techniques.\\n- **Scalability:** All three models are designed for scalability. Gemini's joint multimodal training and multiple sizes, GPT-4's large-scale training, and Mixtral's sparse expert routing all facilitate scaling to handle complex tasks and large datasets.\\n\\n### References\\n\\n1.

Gemini emphasizes multimodal understanding across various data types, GPT-4 combines multimodal inputs with high benchmark performance, and Mixtral leverages sparse expert routing for scalable and efficient inference. Their differences lie in architecture focus—multimodal integration versus expert sparsity—and their applications range from complex reasoning to specialized tasks, with each model pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities.\",\n  \"references\": [\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\",\n      \"url\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11805\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"GPT-4 Technical Report\",\n      \"url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Mixtral of Experts\",\n      \"url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04088\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
