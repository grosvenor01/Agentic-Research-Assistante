The models come in various sizes such as Ultra, Pro, and Nano, optimized for different applications ranging from complex reasoning to device-constrained environments. Gemini models are trained jointly across multiple data types, enabling advanced multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities. They outperform many existing models in multimodal tasks and are designed with responsible deployment practices.\\n\\n**GPT-4:** Developed by OpenAI, GPT-4 is a large-scale multimodal Transformer-based model capable of processing both image and text inputs to generate text outputs. It exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing the bar exam. GPT-4 is trained to predict the next token in a sequence and is fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). It is known for its versatility in NLP tasks, with high performance on benchmarks like MMLU.\\n\\n**Mixtral-style Mixture-of-Experts (MoE):** Mixtral is a sparse MoE language model with a large number of parameters (up to 47B active during inference). It features multiple experts per layer, with a router network selecting a subset of experts for each token, enabling efficient scaling and specialization. Variants like Mixtral 8x7B and 8x22B outperform models like Llama 2 70B on various benchmarks, including mathematics, code generation, and multilingual tasks. The MoE architecture allows for high scalability and efficiency during inference.\\n\\n### Key Features and Design Principles\\n\\n- **Gemini:** Multimodal joint training, multiple sizes, advanced multimodal understanding, responsible deployment.\\n- **GPT-4:** Transformer architecture, multimodal inputs, high benchmark performance, fine-tuning with RLHF.\\n- **Mixtral MoE:** Sparse routing, expert specialization, large parameter count with active parameters during inference, high scalability.\\n\\n### Impact on Reasoning, Costs, and Scalability\\n\\n- **Reasoning Capabilities:** Gemini and GPT-4 demonstrate advanced reasoning across multiple modalities, with Gemini showing remarkable multimodal reasoning and GPT-4 excelling in professional and academic benchmarks. Mixtral's expert routing enables complex reasoning by leveraging specialized experts.\\n- **Inference Costs:** Mixtral's sparse MoE architecture reduces inference costs by activating only a subset of parameters. GPT-4 and Gemini, with their large sizes, have higher inference costs but are optimized for efficiency through model design and training techniques.\\n- **Scalability:** All three models are designed for scalability. Gemini's joint multimodal training and multiple sizes, GPT-4's large-scale training, and Mixtral's sparse expert routing all facilitate scaling to handle complex tasks and large datasets.\\n\\n### References\\n\\n1.
