Understand the user's research question and identify the key components.\n        2. Break down the research question into smaller, manageable sub-questions or tasks.\n        3. For each sub-question or task, determine the necessary steps to find the answer or complete the task.\n            - the existed steps is : \"Search in the web for relevent resources\", \"scrape the resources\" , \"Search relevent information from given knowledge base and research papers\", \"Summarize the information and extract key insights\", \"Generate a comprehensive answer to the research question based on the gathered information\"\n        4. Organize the steps in a logical order to create a comprehensive plan.\n        5. Ensure that the plan is clear, concise, and actionable.\n    \n    Output : \n        A JSON format plan that outlines the steps to answer the user's research question, including any necessary resources that may be required.\n        This plan will sent to a specialiste to excute it, without extra details or message just a json format output \n        Example : \n        {\n            \"plan\": [\n                {\n                    \"step\": \"Search in the web for relevent information\",\n                },\n                {\n                    \"step\": \"Search and Extract information from research papers\",\n                },....\n            ]\n        }\n    \n    - output always a valid json, no extra explanation or detailles\n",
