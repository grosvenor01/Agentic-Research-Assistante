Answer : The architectural differences between Gemini, GPT-4, and Mixtral-style Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models are rooted in their core design principles, component structures, and optimization strategies, which significantly influence their reasoning ability, inference cost, and scalability.

**Gemini**: As a recent model, Gemini's architecture emphasizes multi-modal capabilities and efficient transformer-based design. It integrates specialized modules for handling different data modalities, such as text and images, within a unified transformer framework. This multi-modal integration enhances reasoning across diverse data types but may introduce additional complexity in model training and inference.

**GPT-4**: GPT-4 employs a large-scale transformer architecture with extensive depth and width, utilizing self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies. Its design focuses on scaling up parameters and training data to improve reasoning and generalization. GPT-4 does not inherently incorporate mixture-of-experts modules but relies on dense transformer layers, which can be computationally intensive.

**Mixtral-style Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)**: Mixtral models utilize a sparse MoE architecture, where multiple expert subnetworks are trained, but only a subset is activated during inference. This design allows for scaling to billions of parameters while maintaining manageable inference costs. The routing mechanism determines which experts to activate, enabling specialization and improved reasoning in specific domains.

**Design Choices and Their Effects**:
- *Reasoning Ability*: Gemini's multi-modal modules and Mixtral's expert specialization enhance reasoning across modalities and tasks. GPT-4's deep transformer layers facilitate complex reasoning through extensive context modeling.
- *Inference Cost*: Dense models like GPT-4 have high inference costs due to their large parameter count. Mixtral's sparse MoE reduces inference costs by activating only relevant experts, while Gemini's multi-modal modules may add complexity.
- *Scalability*: Mixtral's sparse routing allows for efficient scaling to larger models without proportional increases in inference cost. GPT-4's dense architecture faces scalability challenges, whereas Gemini's multi-modal design requires careful engineering to scale effectively.
