Answer : The architectural differences between Gemini, GPT-4, and Mixtral-style Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models are rooted in their design choices, layer structures, and component integration, which significantly influence their reasoning ability, inference cost, and scalability.

**Gemini**: Although specific detailed architecture information on Gemini is limited, recent research indicates that Gemini employs advanced transformer-based architectures with optimized attention mechanisms and possibly incorporates multi-modal capabilities. Its design emphasizes efficient parameter utilization and enhanced reasoning through specialized modules, which improve reasoning ability while maintaining manageable inference costs. Gemini's architecture likely leverages modular design principles to facilitate scalability across different tasks.

**GPT-4**: GPT-4 is based on a transformer architecture with a large number of parameters, utilizing dense self-attention mechanisms across multiple layers. Its design emphasizes depth and width to enhance reasoning capabilities, but this comes with high inference costs due to the dense attention computations. GPT-4's scalability is achieved through extensive model parallelism and optimization techniques, allowing it to handle large-scale data and complex tasks effectively.

**Mixtral-style Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)**: Mixtral models adopt a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, where multiple expert subnetworks are trained, and a gating mechanism dynamically selects relevant experts for each input. This design significantly reduces inference costs by activating only a subset of experts, leading to sparse computation. The MoE architecture enhances scalability by allowing models to grow in size without a proportional increase in inference cost, and it can improve reasoning by specializing experts for different reasoning types.

**Impact of Design Choices**:
- **Reasoning Ability**: Gemini's modular and multi-modal features, GPT-4's deep transformer layers, and Mixtral's expert specialization all aim to improve reasoning. Mixtral's sparse activation allows for more specialized reasoning pathways.
- **Inference Cost**: Dense models like GPT-4 have high inference costs due to full attention and large parameter counts. Gemini balances this with optimized modules, while Mixtral reduces inference costs via sparse expert activation.
- **Scalability**: Mixtral's architecture inherently supports scalability through sparse activation, enabling larger models without linear increases in inference cost. GPT-4 scales via parallelism and optimization, whereas Gemini's modular design supports scaling across tasks.

Evaluation : 
Faithfulness (Score: 7) : The answer accurately describes general architectural features of GPT-4 and Mixtral MoE models, citing relevant research. However, details about Gemini are somewhat speculative due to limited publicly available information, and the references provided are somewhat generic, with one being a placeholder (arXiv link with 'XXXX.XXXX'). 

Coverage (Score: 8) : The response covers the key aspects of architecture, reasoning ability, inference cost, and scalability for all three models, providing a comparative analysis aligned with the user's question. It also references specific research papers, fulfilling the requirement well. 

Coherence (Score: 8) : The answer is logically organized, clearly differentiating each model's architecture and its impact on various performance metrics. The flow from architecture to effects on reasoning, inference, and scalability is smooth and understandable. 

Citation_accuracy (Score: 7) : The citations are relevant and correctly attributed to the models discussed. However, the Gemini reference is a preprint with a placeholder URL, which diminishes accuracy. The other references are appropriate and correctly linked to the claims made.
